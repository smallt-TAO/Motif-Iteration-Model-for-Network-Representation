# Motif-Iteration-Model-for-Network-Representation

This code is designed for "Motif Iteration Model for Network Representation".

## Abstractï¼š
Social media mining has become one of the most popular research
areas in Big Data with the explosion of social networking information
from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Weibo and so on. Understanding
and representing the structure of a social network is a key in social media
mining. In this paper, we propose the Motif Iteration Model (MIM) to
represent the structure of a social network. As the name suggested, the
new model is based on iteration of basic network motifs. In order to better
show the properties of the model, a heuristic and greedy algorithm
called Vertex Reordering and Arranging (VRA) is proposed by studying
the adjacency matrix of the three-vertex undirected network motifs. The
algorithm is for mapping from the adjacency matrix of a network to a
binary image, it shows a new perspective of network structure visualization.
In summary, this model provides a useful approach towards building
link between images and networks and offers a new way of representing
the structure of a social network.
